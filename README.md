Whether itâ€™s movies, TV shows, or any other media content, easily specify the download details, and the server takes care of the rest, placing your files exactly where you want them in your Plex server.

## ðŸ›  Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Go:** Make sure you have Go installed on your server. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Navigate to the desired location on your server and run:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:jacogrande/bifrost.git
   cd bifrost
   ```

2. **Run the Server:**

## ðŸš© Options

### --init flag

Bifrost supports multiple download destinations, allowing you to have separate directories for your movies, tv shows, and more.
To make the setup process smooth, an initialization option `--init` is available which prompts user inputs to configure download folders, ensuring a quick and easy setup.

#### How it Works

- **Get Folder Name and Path:**
  You will be prompted to enter a name and a path for the folder where the downloaded content should be stored.
- **Permission Check:**
  The provided folder path will be checked for read and write permissions to ensure smooth file storage.
- **Save Folder Information:**
  Upon successful verification, the folderâ€™s name and path will be stored, and used for subsequent downloads.

This function loopingly prompts you to enter folder details and saves them upon validating the provided path's permissions.
